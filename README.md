# Rice.py – Meal Planner App
INST 326 group project 
Rice.py is a Python-based meal planner designed to help users organize their weekly meals and simplify grocery shopping. The program allows users to add meals with ingredients, assign them to specific days, view a full weekly plan, and automatically generate a shopping list based on selected meals.

# What the Program Does
- Lets the user add meals with a name, meal type, and ingredients
- Stores meals inside a weekly plan (Monday–Sunday)
- Shows the full weekly meal schedule
- Creates a shopping list from all meals added to the plan
- Allows the user to view, update, and clear lists
- Uses multiple classes that work together

# Classes We Created
- Meal
Represents one meal and its ingredients.

- WeeklyPlan
Stores meals assigned to each day.

- ShoppingList
Collects ingredients and creates a grocery list.

- MealPlannerApp
Runs the main menu and connects all the other classes.

Each class has several methods (more than eight total methods per class as required).
